Natours – A Tour Booking Backend API
Hey there!
This is a Node.js API project I built while learning backend development.
It’s a backend system for a tour booking platform — something like a simplified version of what a travel site might use.

Built With:
  Node.js + Express
  MongoDB + Mongoose
  JWT Authentication & Authorization
  REST API with MVC Pattern
  Postman for Testing
  Deployment (Render)
  Pugs

Features:
  Signup / login / protect routes
  Only admins can manage tours
  Filter, sort, paginate tours
  Users can make bookings
  Geo-location search (tours near you)
  Data sanitization, rate limiting, and error handling middleware
  Basic image upload, secure data, and real-world error handling
  Stripe-style payment simulation for bookings
  Secure user authentication and role-based authorization
  Fully structured MVC architecture

What I Learned
 How to build a scalable project using the MVC pattern
 Managing complex API routes and middleware stacks
 Writing reusable code (like custom error handlers and query filters)
 Setting up user roles and access control
 Connecting MongoDB with Mongoose and designing schemas
 Using Postman to test and debug API flows efficiently
